        quest: "What is credit limit?",
        ans: "Your FASTHELP limit is the maximum loan you're allowed to have at a given time. The size of your credit limit affects the loan size you have with your FASTHELP, i.e. the larger your credit limit, the more you can borrow from linkcredit. Once you reach your credit limit, you can't make any additional loan until you pay off some of your outstanding balance."
    },

        id: 6,
        quest: "How to get a higher credit limit?",
        ans: "You're not necessarily stuck with the credit limit you start out with. After several months of using your FASTHELP responsibly, we may automatically raise your credit limit."
